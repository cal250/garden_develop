# Breakpoints

The following breakpoints are available in our design system. We use a mobile-first approach.

- `xs` - @media (min-width: 375px)
- `sm` - @media (min-width: 640px)
- `md` - @media (min-width: 1024px)
- `lg` - @media (min-width: 1280px)
- `xl` - @media (min-width: 1536px)

## Tailwind

The breakpoints are available as tailwind classes.

```html
<div class="hidden sm:block">This is visible on `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` breakpoints</div>
```


# Hooks

## useBreakpoints

The `useBreakpoints` hook is available to provide the current breakpoint.

```jsx
import { useBreakpoints } from "@hooks/use-breakpoint";

const { isXs, isSm, isMd, isLg, isXl } = useBreakpoints();
```

## useResponsiveValue

The `useResponsiveValue` hook is available to provide a responsive value based on the current breakpoint.

```jsx
import { useResponsiveValue } from "@hooks/use-responsive-value";

const value = useResponsiveValue({
  base: "The base value",
  sm: "tablet value",
  md: "laptop value",
  lg: "desktop value",
  xl: "extra large value",
});
```

If a value is not provided for a breakpoint, the value for the next smallest breakpoint will be used.

```jsx
import { useResponsiveValue } from "@hooks/use-responsive-value";

const value = useResponsiveValue({
  base: "The base value",
  lg: "desktop value",
});
```

In this example, the `value` will be `"The base value"` for `sm` and `md` breakpoints. It will be `"desktop value"` for `lg` and `xl` breakpoints.
